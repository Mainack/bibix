A project that came out of pure frustration with the current Gui options for article/reference/bibtex management (such as mekentosj's Papers, Papers2, Mendeley, Zotero, Bibdesk, etc). This program is geared toward CS researchers who love latex, bibtex, command lines, (and vim, not emacs ;-) j/k emacs is also cool).

Key features that other tools cant do well:

**Import massive database of bibtex** Supports 10s of thousands of articles in the database.
**Elegant and snappy cmd line interface.** Browse and search your database and create custom lists of goodness
**Just use it for a while and enjoy the goodness.** Written is simple and pure python. Very extensible.
